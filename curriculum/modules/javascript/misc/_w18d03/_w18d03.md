### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** Q&A on several topics such how `JSON.stringify` deals with functions, what are `Circular References`, the difference between `null` and `undefined`, CSS pseudo-elements and the `attr()` rule, debugging a search box algorithm and more!
  - **Part 2:** We continue debugging and improving the search algorithm, learn about `Number.isInteger` method and `isNaN`, and also learn some cool advanced DOM manipulation methods and properties.  

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week18/assets/code/day03){:target="_blank"}

  **Lecture Notes & Questions:**

  Example of a *Circular reference*:

  ```js
  const obj = {  
    name: "Dillion",  
    isDev: true,  
    hobbies: ["singing", "writing"],  
    age: 100,  
  }  
  obj.prop = obj; 
  // (Cannot be stringified due to the infinite reference to itself)    
  ```

  - `JSON.stringify`: *“Arrays are serialized as arrays (enclosed by square brackets). Only array indices between 0 and length - 1 (inclusive) are serialized; **other properties are ignored**.”*  

  - **Best Practices:**  
    - Object rule: dynamic property names ALWAYS inside `[ brackets ]`. Don’t use the . notation. Tip: name your objects like, studentsObj, productsObject, etc.  
    - **ALWAYS handle error cases** in development  
      - **BREAK THE CODE intentionally,** handle it and **ALWAYS give some user-friendly feedback** to the users  
  - `JSON.stringify` will discard functions  
    - In the case of an Array containing functions, they are converted to null to avoid breaking the Array length and indices.
