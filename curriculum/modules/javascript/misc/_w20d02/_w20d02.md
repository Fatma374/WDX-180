  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Here's the plan for today: **build things!**

  Scroll down to the `Exercises` section and start coding.

### Summary

### Exercises

  - 1) Create a basic Nodejs Webserver that serves a simple HTML form with an email and password input fields. You must be able to login successfully using the email "admin@gmail.com" and password "1234" and land on an admin page (be creative) otherwise get redirected to an unauthorized page.

  - 2) Try out the fetch API in Node.js: replace `kostasx` with your GitHub username

  ```js
  const URL = "https://api.github.com/users/kostasx";
  fetch(URL)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      // console.log the name, company and location from the data
      // In the following format "<name> is currently working at <company> and is based in <location>", example "Kostas Minaidis is working at Intechgration.io and is based in Athens, Greece / Berlin, Germany"
    })
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
  ```

  - 3) Integrate the above code into a [web server](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs#an-example-nodejs-application){:target="_blank"}. 

  - 4) Create another Nodejs Web server that displays fetches and displays jokes from the following API:

    - [https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/){:target="_blank"}
