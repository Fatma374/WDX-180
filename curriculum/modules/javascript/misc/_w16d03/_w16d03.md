  **Suggested material for study & practice:**

  - Check the [Event Listeners on the DevTools](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/24-view-event-listeners/)  
  - Check the [getEventListeners()](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/utilities#getEventListeners-function)  
  - Why does the **performance.eventCounts.get("click")** show 0 at the first click?

  **References & Resources:**

  - [**Primitives**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive)  
  - [**auto-boxing behavior**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive)**:** *“Primitives have no methods but still behave as if they do. When properties are accessed on primitives, JavaScript auto-boxes the value into a wrapper object and accesses the property on that object instead.”*
