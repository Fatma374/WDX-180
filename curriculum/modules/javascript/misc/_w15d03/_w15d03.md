  - **Study** the [Event Flow diagram](https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-DOM-Level-3-Events-20031107/events.html#Events-flow-h2){:target="_blank"} (again) to understand what happens every single time an event is triggered.  

  - **Study and experiment** with the code that we’ve created during the first session: [](){:target="_blank"}
