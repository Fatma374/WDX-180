### Schedule

  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Here's the recommended plan for today: move straight to the [Exercises](#exercises) section below and start practicing your React skills!

### Summary

### Exercises

  - Start a React Vite project from scratch and connect it to a GitHub repository.
  - Enable Tailwind by following the guide here: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite){:target="_blank"}
  - Install the [handy VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=riazxrazor.html-to-jsx){:target="_blank"} that converts copy-pasted HTML to JSX
  - Install [prop-types package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types){:target="_blank"}
  - Start moving the code from the [Twitter HTML clone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/refs/heads/main/curriculum/week22/assets/day01/exercises/Twitter.Clone.html){:target="_blank"} to your JSX app.

  - Bonus points: 
    - Each Tweet should not be repeated. There should be a `<Tweet />` Component that you will loop over (create an Array of tweet objects and use that).
    - Ideally, you should have a strict check on the PropTypes of the `<Tweet />` component
    - Each Trend should ideally be a single Component (with its own `propTypes`) that repeats based on a loop
    - Each Follower should ideally be a single Component (with its own `propTypes`) that repeats based on a loop
