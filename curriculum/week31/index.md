      <span class="summary-day">Week 31 - Day 1</span> | Object Constructors & Object Instances</h2>
  </summary>

### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** TypeScript, Objects Constructors & Instances
  - **Part 2:** TypeScript, Objects Constructors & Instances

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/week31/assets/day01/code){:target="_blank"} and the diagram [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/blob/main/curriculum/week31/assets/day01/20.05.2024-Object.Hierarchies.png){:target="_blank"}.

  **References & Resources:**

  - [Object.hasOwn()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwn){:target="_blank"}  
    - Introduced in [ES2022](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2022/#sec-object.hasown){:target="_blank"}  
    - ...and not available [before that](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2021/#sec-properties-of-the-object-constructor){:target="_blank"}  
  - [Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors){:target="_blank"}  
  - [Axel Rauschmayer: JavaScript inheritance: beyond the basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyClWddeO_A){:target="_blank"}

  - For private methods/properties we can use:  
    - the *private* keyword in TypeScript  
    - the `#` hash character in JavaScript

  **Lecture Questions:**

  - Property `hasOwn` does not exist on type `ObjectConstructor`. Do you need to change your target library? Try changing the `lib` compiler option to `es2022` or later. `Object.hasOwn(pet,"run")` üò∞   
  -   `pet.hasOwnProperty("run")`  
    - [SO: Property 'assign' does not exist on type 'ObjectConstructor'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35959372/property-assign-does-not-exist-on-type-objectconstructor){:target="_blank"}  
  - Are static methods/properties the same as private methods/properties?  
    - No   
  - What is an *instance*?  
    - Any object created using the new keyword. The object is always **an instance of** the Class or Function Constructor that created it.

### Exercises

  - [instanceof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof){:target="_blank"}  
  - [Sparse Arrays (vs Dense Arrays)](https://2ality.com/2012/06/dense-arrays.html)  
    - Also follow and read this blog and his books, articles and videos  
  - [Study private properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_properties)  
  - Investigate (more) on the difference between: **if ( obj.prop ) and if ( ‚Äúprop‚Äù in obj )**  
    - *‚ÄúA property may be present in an object but have value undefined. Therefore, x in obj is not the same as obj.x \!== undefined.‚Äù \~ The in operator @ [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in#description)*  
  - Try the following:  
    - Create a class (e.g. Cat, Fish) and/or constructor and then create instances of Cat and Fish (e.g. siameseCat) and try using the **object instanceof Cat** check.  
  - [Array Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array)  
  - [**Start this TypeScript course**](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript)

  **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheet for this day is: **/user/week31/progress/progress.draft.w31.d01.csv**

  You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../week01/resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).
