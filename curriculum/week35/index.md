### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - **Part 1:** Decompose our main app into a web server and a database file. Talk about asynchronous code.
  - **Part 2:** Continue our talk on asynchronous code and async/await. Database PRIMARY and FOREIGN keys.

  You can find the lecture code [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/build-a-cms-2024/tree/595a9d765bccd8418c7d20926f7730d4b70e7b64){:target="_blank"}

<!-- Summary -->

### Exercises

  - Study: how **import** (ESM) vs **require** (CommonJS) behave in Node (20+)  
    - [Nodejs Docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#import-statements){:target="_blank"}  
    - `await` is ONLY awaiting for Promises:  
      - `await setTimeout()` `‚ùå`  
      - Convert the async function into a Promise using the `new Promise()` and then await: **await promisifiedSetTimeout()**  
    - Make HTTP requests from the CLI: `cURL` and `wget`  
      - cURL: curl [http://oxylabs.io](http://oxylabs.io){:target="_blank"}  
    - [https://nodejs.org/en/learn/modules/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/modules/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction){:target="_blank"}

  - Tasks/Challenges:  
    - Find out a better way to create and format the output HTML. For example, create a template function: `show_template(page_type,vars)`  
    - Create and return a Login page  
    - Make sure to handle the `req.url` splitting appropriately. Now, if there is no `?user_id=100`, the code breaks  
    - Make sure that if the user is not found in the DB, you get some response  
    - See if you can serve a favicon and some CSS along with the pages  
    - Create a 404 page

  **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to complete all the tasks found in the **daily Progress Sheet** and update the sheet accordingly. Once you've updated the sheet, don't forget to `commit` and `push`. The progress draft sheet for this day is: **/user/week35/progress/progress.draft.w35.d01.csv**

  You should **NEVER** update the `draft` sheets directly, but rather work on a copy of them according to the instructions [found here](../week01/resources/PROGRESS-WORKFLOW.md).
