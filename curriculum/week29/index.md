  </summary>

### Schedule

  - **Watch the lectures**
  - **Study the suggested material**
  - **Practice on the topics and share your questions**

### Study Plan

  Your instructor will share the video lectures with you. Here are the topics covered:

  - Building a Battleship game with JavaScript - Part 5 
  - Building a Battleship game with JavaScript - Part 6

  You can find the lecture code [here](){:target="_blank"}

  **Study & Practice**

  - Think about a way to display the columns and rows (A, B, C... 1, 2, 3)  
    - Start by hardcoding the cols/rows, then implement a dynamic way that scales  
    - Consider both HTML and Canvas solutions and think about the pros and cons of each solution  
    - Try to leave the player canvas functionality and code out of it. The decorative code that displays the cols and rows should not affect the **main game** functionality.
